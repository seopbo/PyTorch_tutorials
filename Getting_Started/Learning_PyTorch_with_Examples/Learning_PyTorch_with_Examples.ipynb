If you are reusing the same graph over and over, then this potentially costly up-front optimization can be amortized as the same graph is rerun over and over.\n",

With a static graph the loop construct needs to be a part of the graph; for this reason TensorFlow provides operators such as `tf.scan` for embedding loops into the graph. With dynamic graphs the situation is simpler: since we build graphs on-the-fly for each example, we can use normal imperative flow control to perform computation that differs for each input.\n",
